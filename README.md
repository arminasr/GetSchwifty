iOS application for Swift, Cocoa, iOS & macOS community providing a list of conferences. This is an experimental project whose main intent was to try out Swift Package Manager (SPM) and learn a bit about SwiftUI and Combine frameworks provided by Apple. Turns out this application could be useful for the community ðŸ™ƒ.
